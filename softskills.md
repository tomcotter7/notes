## Personal Ideas

This sections lists my personal professional revelations, specifically on just being a better producer of high quality work.

- **Evaluation is key**!
    - Decisions and next steps should consistently be made off of evaluation
    - Whether that's pre-project decisions (aka looking at the data), or post-project (aka looking at online metrics) it doesn't matter.
- **Graphical presentations**!
    - Work should be presented in a manner that is easy to comprehend by everyone involved.
    - For instance, business insights should be right at the top, followed by easily digestible graphics which effectively convey the point. Only then should the technical writing come.
- Impostor syndrome is in a sense "fake" & can be fought past in one of two ways. I personally like to do both.
    - Locking in - just ensuring that you are always doing as much work as possible.
    - Meditative - sitting with the feeling and understanding that it won't last forever.
