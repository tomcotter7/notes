## Reasearch within a Company

### Google's Hybrid Approach to Research

This [paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/38149.pdf) details Google's approach to research inside their company. The main point that it boils down to is that **they structure their research such that it is easy to show why it is being done**. 

They define it as *Hybrid Research* which essentially means that engineering and research teams are not silo'd & work is broken down into small measurable steps (each of which may be of commercial value).

They essentially couple Research & Development, so that if a piece of research proves successful, it becomes very easy to port it into Google's ecosystem.
